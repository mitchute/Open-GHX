  Abstract                 = {Most cooling reservoirs in the U.S. employ a surface intake, but many could obtain improved performance (decreased intake temperature during summer) by using a submerged intake. Potential improvements were studied using mathematical hydrothermal modeling applied to five hypothetical reservoirs located in Augusta, Ga. For the base case reservoir—characterized by an average depth of 30 ft (9.1 m), surface area of 2,000 acres (809 ha), and areal loading of 0.99 MWt/acre—and a range of vertical mixing parameters, intake temperatures from Apr.-Oct. decreased by an average of 0.7-1.2° F (0.4-0.7° C) using a submerged intake as compared with a surface intake. For a range of assumed turbine performance curves and cost parameters, these temperatures yield estimated energy savings of 1,200,000-20,400,000 kWh annually and total, present valued, cost savings of $700,000-$11,600,000. Savings increase as the reservoir area and depth increase and vertical mixing decreases. In most cases, performance also improves with combined use of a surface and a submerged intake, with the former used during initial periods of the annual stratification cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {This work deals with the efficiency and the energy behavior of Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs) used for heating and cooling of buildings. In particular horizontal type heat exchangers have been investigated for different configurations, in order to evaluate the characteristics of these systems in the most common layouts and in different working conditions. The main results pointed out the heat fluxes transferred to and from the ground and the efficiency of the system. The calculations were made with the CFD code Fluent and the simulations covered one year of system operation, both in summer and winter for typical climate conditions of the South of Italy. The most important parameter for the heat transfer performance of the system resulted the thermal conductivity of the ground around the heat exchanger and the optimal ground type was that with the highest thermal conductivity (3 W/m K in the cases analyzed in this work). The choice of the velocity of the heat transfer fluid inside the tubes was another key factor. The depth of installation of the horizontal ground heat exchangers did not play an important role on the system performance. The helical heat exchanger arrangement resulted as the best performing one.},

  Abstract                 = {Horizontal ground heat exchangers have been widely used in many countries as the heat source for ground-source heat pump systems. When abundant land space is available for the installation of ground heat exchangers, the horizontal ground heat exchangers provide a cost-effective choice because the installation costs of horizontal ground heat exchangers are much lower than those of vertical ground heat exchangers. Slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers, which are basically coiled ground heat exchangers, require less land space than conventional straight horizontal ground heat exchangers because of the higher installation density of heat exchange pipes per given area. However, at present, the slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers tend to be over- or undersized because of the lack of an appropriate design method for them. In this research on the optimum design of slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers, a commercial finite-element simulator, FEFLOW, was used to simulate the performance of slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers taking into account the energy balance at the land surface. The accuracy of the developed simulation model was validated through history-matching calculations on the basis of the results of thermal response tests and a long-term air-conditioning test under various test conditions. In history matching, reasonable agreement was obtained between the measured and simulated values of the heat medium and ground temperatures, demonstrating the reliability of the developed numerical simulation model using FEFLOW.},

  Abstract                 = {The article: A small but growing number of data centers are slashing their cooling costs by using the environment as their chiller, tapping nearby rivers, underground lakes, wells and even the Baltic Sea. A new project in Norway plans to draw cold water from an adjacent fjord and use it to cool data halls.The Green Mountain Data Center is located on the shores of the island of Rennesoy, inside concrete buildings within caves carved out of the mountain. Racks of servers will now fill underground halls that once stored ammunition for NATO.The project is being developed by the investment arm of the Norwegian shipping firm Smedvig, which is working with a leading Nordic IT services firm, ErgoGroup, and electric utility Lyse Energi.The ability to use the fjord as a low-cost source for chilled water was a major advantage of the Rennesoy location. Green Mountain's cooling system taps the fjord for a steady supply of water at 8 degrees C (46 degrees F), which is optimal for use in data center cooling systems.Chilled water is a key component of many data center cooling systems. This water is often supplied by chillers, large refrigeration units that require a hefty amount of electricity to operate. Eliminating the chillers will usually allow a data center to operate with lower energy bills than similar facilities using chillers.The Green Mountain Data Center is being built out in two phases. The first phase is designed for traditional colocation space, and will include about 7,000 square meters (about 75,000 square feet) of data center space. Another 4,000 square meters (43,000 square feet) will house data center container solutions, which will also use chilled water for cooling.The developers are in the late stages of negotiations with Norwegian clients, but believe the facility may be attractive to multi-nationals based in the U.S. and Europe. ``We are now mainly focusing on corporate customers with worldwide facilities who wish to reduce their carbon footprint across their portfolio of data centres, improve their `green credentials' and reduce spending on power,'' said Jonathan Evans of Green Mountain.The build-out of the colocation halls will begin in January, and the power to the facility is also being upgraded. Green Mountain expects the first clients to be installed in late 2012. Here's a video providing a conceptual overview of the project.},

  Abstract                 = {Field investigations in the hydrologic sciences often are limited by the ability to collect data at the high spatiotemporal resolution necessary to build accurate predictive models or to control complex engineered systems in real time. Here, we describe LakeNet, an embedded wireless sensor network constructed by an interdisciplinary team of hydrogeologists, environmental engineers, and electrical engineers at the University of Notre Dame. Off-the-shelf temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH probes are suspended from floating, waterproof cases with electronics, forming sensor pods. Wireless transmission to relay stations and a PC gateway enable researchers to interact with the network remotely to alter sampling patterns, download data, and analyze data trends using the gateway’s recursive processing of raw data. LakeNet functions as a “smart” network, in which each pod is aware of surrounding pods. Ongoing research will allow in-network computation to detect change points in the data stream, thus triggering altered sampling strategy in response to sensed events or individual probe/pod failure. This ability for the sensor network to alter sampling strategy can increase sensor shelf life, which will become more important as novel sensors are developed, and decrease system energy requirements. Initial deployment at St. Mary’s Lake on the Notre Dame campus in the fall of 2005 showed that temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen changes were consistent with diurnal fluctuations in sunlight, hence, photosynthesis. In describing LakeNet, we summarize current capabilities and ongoing research, including some of the challenges that need to be overcome for further sensor network development, widespread deployment, and maximum usefulness.},

  Abstract                 = {The Slinky heat exchanger research project was designed to experimentally determine Slinky performance characteristics for use in heat exchanger design. There were three phases to the project. The first tested relative performance of Slinky heat exchangers in spoils backfill with four different pipe arrangements, all with equivalent coil diameters and total feet of pipe, placed in trenches of various lengths. A second series tested the performance of Slinky heat exchangers with a flowable backfill material. Two groups of Slinkys were tested during this phase. One group was installed with flowable fill in four trenches, including a 40-foot trench (500 feet of pipe), 80-foot trench (1000 feet of pipe), 99-foot trench (500 feet of pipe) and 100-foot trench (750 feet of pipe). The second configuration maintained the 99-foot flowable backfill trench, and with it a 40-foot and 99-foot trench from the first test series, along with a 250-foot U-bend in a 6 foot deep horizontal bore. A third series of tests was done using a controlled bench test apparatus on a 40 foot long Slinky with 500 feet of pipe. This report discusses the data and presents a method for incorporating this information into Slinky heat exchanger designs.},

  Abstract                 = {Results from both experimental measurements and 3D numerical simulations of Ground Source Heat Pump systems (GSHP) at a UK climate are presented. Experimental measurements of a horizontal-coupled slinky GSHP were undertaken in Talbot Cottage at Drayton St Leonard site, Oxfordshire, UK. The measured thermophysical properties of in situ soil were used in the CFD model. The thermal performance of slinky heat exchangers for the horizontal-coupled GSHP system for different coil diameters and slinky interval distances was investigated using a validated 3D model. Results from a two month period of monitoring the performance of the GSHP system showed that the COP decreased with the running time. The average COP of the horizontal-coupled GSHP was 2.5. The numerical prediction showed that there was no significant difference in the specific heat extraction of the slinky heat exchanger at different coil diameters. However, the larger the diameter of coil, the higher the heat extraction per meter length of soil. The specific heat extraction also increased, but the heat extraction per meter length of soil decreased with the increase of coil central interval distance.},

  Abstract                 = {Ground source heat pump systems are an energy efficient heating and cooling technology for residential and commercial buildings. The main barrier to adoption is the higher investment cost compared to conventional systems. Where available land area permits, horizontal ground heat exchangers are generally less expensive than vertical borehole-type ground heat exchangers (GHXs). A further cost reduction can be made by using SlinkyTM ground heat exchangers, which require less trench space and hence reduce the installation cost, in many cases. It is desirable to formulate an accurate model for simulation purposes; such simulations can be used in both design tools and in energy analysis programs. The model formulated in this paper relies on analytical ring source solutions to compute temperature response functions for both horizontal and vertical SlinkyTM heat exchangers. The algorithm used to calculate the response factors have several features that significantly increase computation speed. The thermal effect of the detailed ground heat balance on the GHXs is considered by superimposing the undisturbed ground temperature calculated using a numerical model. For use in whole-building simulations where the GHX may be connected to other components, the model is formulated to calculate both heat transfer rate and exiting fluid temperature, given entering fluid temperature. The model has been validated against the previously published experimental data; and is implemented in a whole-building energy simulation program EnergyPlus.},
